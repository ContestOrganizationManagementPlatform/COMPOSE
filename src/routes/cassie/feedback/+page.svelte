			author_id (string | null): Supabase ID of the user who wrote the problem; 
			comment_latex (string | null): Comments given by the author of the problem written in LaTeX; 
			created_at (string | null): Timestamp problem was created at; 
			difficulty (number | null): Difficulty rating of the problem; 
			edited_at (string | null): Timestamp the problem was last edited at; 
			front_id (string | null): An identifier for each problem given by the first 3 letters of the author's full name with the id number;

			id (number | null): Unique ID number of the problem; 
			nickname (string | null): Nickname for each problem;

			solution_latex (string | null): The solution to the problem written in LaTeX;
			sub_topics (string | null): Comma-separated list of topics which appear in the problem – sub-topics are more granular than topics and tend to cover tactics or themes present in the problem and solution; 
			topics (string | null): Comma-separated list of the overall topics that appear in the problem – all topics are chosen from Algebra, Combinatorics, Number Theory, Geometry;
