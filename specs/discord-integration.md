# Discord Integration

## Goal
Use Discord as a way to facilitate more interaction between problem writers and the COMPOSE Platform. The goal is to use a combination of discord messages, forum posts, threads, and DMs to facilitate problem writers to think about and give feedback on each other's problems in a more natural, everyday manner.

## Design Specs
- Keep a [Discord Forum](https://discord.com/blog/forum-channels-space-for-organized-conversation) that mimics the database.
  - Use tags to keep track of subjects
  - Automatically "close" posts after periods of inactivity?
  - Use interactable buttons/components to include links to problem-specific links on COMPOSE (e.g. view problem, edit problem, provide feedback)
  - Have problem edits and new feedback updated in the relevant forum discussion
- Problem Creation
  -   Make new post in forum using [Embeds](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-object)
  -   Use [Discord Interactions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components) under the post to have relevant buttons (view problem, edit problem, add feedback) that link to the relevant COMPOSE pages
  -   Store the ID of the forum post in the COMPOSE Database so that it can be easily found and edited later. 
- Problem Editing
  - Find and edit the relevant forum thread with the new updates made to a particular problem. 
- Adding Feedback
  - When official feedback is added to COMPOSE, send a feedback added embed to the relevant forum thread
  - Add relevant buttons (view feedback, edit problem) to feedback message.
  - ~~DM Author that new feedback has been added~~

## Tech References/Tips
 - [Discord Developer Docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
   - This is the official documentation for what requests to make and how in order to accomplish your goals.
   - It's sometimes hard to understand and navigate. I've had the most luck using ctrl+F
 - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
   - Unironically very helpful for figuring out how to make the right requests. It will often give you Discord.js code, but if you prompt it enough times you can usually get it to spit out functional HTTP Requests
 - [src/lib/routes/api/discord](https://github.com/ContestOrganizationManagementPlatform/COMPOSE/blob/8b1c31beb917362553c81d8ee2366c5981beaa31/src/routes/api/discord/)
   - Some Discord Integration already exists in the library, so use it as reference!
   - Make new requests from the COMPOSE API by making a new route and putting the relevant requests to that route in a +server.js file ([example](https://github.com/ContestOrganizationManagementPlatform/COMPOSE/blob/8b1c31beb917362553c81d8ee2366c5981beaa31/src/routes/api/discord/interactions/%2Bserver.js#L67))
   - You can see an example of calling the COMPOSE API for Discord things in [lines 413-428 of src/lib/supabase/testsolve.ts](https://github.com/ContestOrganizationManagementPlatform/COMPOSE/blob/8b1c31beb917362553c81d8ee2366c5981beaa31/src/lib/supabase/testsolve.ts#L413C35-L413C35)
